Geolode is the upcoming, and first Lode Up product. It is the result of several side projects that Nic Kline and I have 
worked on together. We had a need, in many projects, for a service that provides geo-location storage and querying. 
With such a service mobile applications can provide better social interactions based on user-to-user proximity. We want 
to open this service up to mobile developers, so they can continue to focus on what they do best without having to 
worry about writing their own geo-location service.

While this is an engineering blog, we would like to chronicle the overall launch of the product, so in addition to 
technical topics we may touch on marketing and business as we are learning and making decisions within those realms. We 
would like to partner with some app developers as we flesh out the full API to make sure we are meeting a broader set 
needs rather than what was needed for our side projects. In the coming weeks we will have a proper landing/early-access
sign-up page up. In the meantime, if you are interested in partnering with us, then please hit us up on twitter; John 
can be reached at [@johnlcox](https://twitter.com/johnlcox) and Nic at [@nic_kline](https://twitter.com/nic_kline).
